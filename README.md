## üå± What I learned

I really enjoyed working on this project and I learned a lot while doing it.

:arrow_right: how to work with **Contenful Delivery API** to fetch the data and render it </br>
:arrow_right: how to utilize **useParams hook** from **React Router** to access the dynamic pieces of the URL</br>
:arrow_right: how to use **custom hooks** to extract some components logic into a reusable functions</br>
:arrow_right: how to apply BEM methodolgy in a project (just for fun since I haven't used it before and I'm always happy to learn something new)
